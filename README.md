# BayesFlow

version 0.1

## Dependencies

The package has the following dependencies:
- Python, including packages numpy, cython, matplotlib, mpi4py and rpy2
- openmpi
- C libraries for linear algebra computations, e.g. cblas and clapack or mkl. 
- gfortran

The dependence on rpy2 is not needed for core functionality, and if installation without this dependency is wanted, files

src/\__init__   
src/utils/\__init__  
src/data/\__init__

should be replaced by

src/\__init_mindep__  
src/utils/\__init_mindep__  
src/data/\__init_mindep__

for example do mv src/\__init_mindep__ src/\__init__ et.c. rpy2 is needed for loading the healthyFlowData data set from R, and it is also needed for diptest computations.

The dependecies can be obtained by following the instructions below.

### Ubuntu

sudo apt-get install gcc, python, openmpi  
sudo pip install numpy, cython, matplotlib, mpi4py, rpy2

### Mac

Python can be installed either using homebrew (http://brew.sh) or MacPorts (https://www.macports.org/). If you do not already have installed any of them, we recommend installing homebrew.

For linear algebra c libraries, you can use the BLAS and LAPACK distributions provided in the Accelerate veclib framework.
